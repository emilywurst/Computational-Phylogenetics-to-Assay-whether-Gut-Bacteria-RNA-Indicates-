Analysis of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 16S RNA amongst species.

This project uses Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 16S rRNA data in a txt format from a beet and 2 human hosts.

Question: Is rRNA 16S genomic data in gastrointestinal microbiota more consistent amongst related species?

Hypothesis: Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus is a common gastrointestinal microbiota found across many species. If the alignment of lacticaseibacillus rhamnsus between two organisms is high, then that organism is more closely related to humans compared to a less similar alignment between a human and a different non-human animal.
